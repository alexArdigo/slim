## Programming Paradigm Comparison

## Functional Programming
**What it is:** Functions as building blocks, no state mutation

**Pros:**
- Very fast execution (no object overhead)
- Easy to parallelize and optimize
- Predictable performance
- Memory efficient with immutable data

**Cons:**
- Can use more memory creating new data instead of modifying
- Learning curve affects development speed
- Some problems don't map well to functional thinking

## Procedural Programming
**What it is:** Step-by-step instructions with functions and variables

**Pros:**
- Fastest execution in Python
- Minimal memory overhead
- Very fast to write and understand
- Direct CPU instructions, no abstraction penalty

**Cons:**
- Poor code reusability
- Becomes unmaintainable in large projects
- No IntelliSense support
- Global state causes debugging issues

## Data-Oriented Programming
**What it is:** Separate data structures from functions that operate on them

**Pros:**
- Good performance (dictionaries are optimized in Python)
- Memory efficient data layout
- Flexible data structures
- Easy serialization

**Cons:**
- Dictionary lookups slower than direct attribute access
- No data protection or validation
- Poor IntelliSense (unless using TypedDict)
- Easy to make typos in key names

## Object-Oriented Programming
**What it is:** Data and methods bundled together in classes

**Pros:**
- Excellent IntelliSense and IDE support
- Great code organization and maintainability
- Strong encapsulation and data protection
- Easy team collaboration

**Cons:**
- Slowest execution (2-5x slower than procedural)
- High memory overhead per object
- Method lookup and attribute access penalties
- Object creation/destruction costs

## Performance Summary (Fastest to Slowest):
1. **Procedural** - Direct, minimal overhead
2. **Functional** - Fast but depends on data structures used
3. **Data-oriented** - Dictionary access costs
4. **OOP** - Multiple layers of indirection and overhead
