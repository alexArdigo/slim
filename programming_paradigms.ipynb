    "## Programming Paradigm Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Programming\n",
    "**What it is:** Functions as building blocks, no state mutation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Very fast execution (no object overhead)\n",
    "- Easy to parallelize and optimize\n",
    "- Predictable performance\n",
    "- Memory efficient with immutable data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Can use more memory creating new data instead of modifying\n",
    "- Learning curve affects development speed\n",
    "- Some problems don't map well to functional thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedural Programming\n",
    "**What it is:** Step-by-step instructions with functions and variables\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Fastest execution in Python\n",
    "- Minimal memory overhead\n",
    "- Very fast to write and understand\n",
    "- Direct CPU instructions, no abstraction penalty\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Poor code reusability\n",
    "- Becomes unmaintainable in large projects\n",
    "- No IntelliSense support\n",
    "- Global state causes debugging issues\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data-Oriented Programming\n",
    "**What it is:** Separate data structures from functions that operate on them\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Good performance (dictionaries are optimized in Python)\n",
    "- Memory efficient data layout\n",
    "- Flexible data structures\n",
    "- Easy serialization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Dictionary lookups slower than direct attribute access\n",
    "- No data protection or validation\n",
    "- Poor IntelliSense (unless using TypedDict)\n",
    "- Easy to make typos in key names\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "**What it is:** Data and methods bundled together in classes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "- Excellent IntelliSense and IDE support\n",
    "- Great code organization and maintainability\n",
    "- Strong encapsulation and data protection\n",
    "- Easy team collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "- Slowest execution (2-5x slower than procedural)\n",
    "- High memory overhead per object\n",
    "- Method lookup and attribute access penalties\n",
    "- Object creation/destruction costs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance Summary (Fastest to Slowest):\n",
    "1. **Procedural** - Direct, minimal overhead\n",
    "2. **Functional** - Fast but depends on data structures used\n",
    "3. **Data-oriented** - Dictionary access costs\n",
    "4. **OOP** - Multiple layers of indirection and overhead"
