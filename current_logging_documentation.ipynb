    "# Logging Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The logging system in `slim_gsgp` provides comprehensive tracking of genetic programming experiments through CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### `logger()`\n",
    "Main logging function that records experiment progress during GP runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where used:**\n",
    "- `slim_gsgp/algorithms/GP/gp.py`, inside the `log_generation` method of the `GP` class, which is called during the evolutionary process in the `solve` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**\n",
    "- `path` (str): CSV file path for logging\n",
    "- `generation` (int): Current generation number\n",
    "- `elite_fit` (float): Best individual's fitness value\n",
    "- `timing` (float): Execution time for the generation\n",
    "- `nodes` (int): Total nodes in population\n",
    "- `additional_infos` (list, optional): Test fitness and diversity metrics\n",
    "- `run_info` (list, optional): Algorithm name, run ID, dataset name\n",
    "- `seed` (int, optional): Random seed used\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# slim_gsgp/algorithms/GP/gp.py\n",
    "logger(\n",
    "    log_path,\n",
    "    generation,\n",
    "    self.elite.fitness,\n",
    "    elapsed_time,\n",
    "    float(population.nodes_count),\n",
    "    additional_infos=add_info,\n",
    "    run_info=run_info,\n",
    "    seed=self.seed,\n",
    ")\n",

    "### `log_settings()`\n",
    "Records experiment configuration settings to a separate CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where used:**\n",
    "- `slim_gsgp/main_gp.py`, at the end of the `gp` function, after the GP run is complete, to log the experiment's configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**\n",
    "- `path` (str): CSV file path (typically ends with `_settings.csv`)\n",
    "- `settings_dict` (list): List of configuration dictionaries (see below for details)\n",
    "- `unique_run_id` (UUID): Unique identifier for the experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "**About `settings_dict` in `log_settings`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When calling `log_settings`, the `settings_dict` argument is a list containing four configuration dictionaries that are merged and logged to ensure full reproducibility of each experiment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **gp_solve_parameters**: Solver configuration, including number of generations, elitism, logging, fitness function, parallel jobs, and run metadata.\n",
    "2. **gp_parameters**: Population and genetic operator settings, such as population size, crossover/mutation probabilities, random seed, and operator functions (mutation, initialization, selection).\n",
    "3. **gp_pi_init**: Population initialization parameters, specifying available terminals, functions, constants, and parameters for initial population creation (e.g., initial depth, probability of constants).\n",
    "4. **settings_dict**: External or experiment-specific configuration loaded from files, such as dataset options, algorithm variants, batch run settings, hardware resources, and any custom overrides.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** The `TERMINALS` entry is removed before logging, as it can be large and dataset-specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# slim_gsgp/main_gp.py\n",
    "gp_solve_parameters['run_info'] = [algo, unique_run_id, dataset_name]\n",
    "log_settings(\n",
    "    path=log_path[:-4] + \"_settings.csv\",\n",
    "    settings_dict=[gp_solve_parameters, gp_parameters, gp_pi_init, settings_dict],\n",
    "    unique_run_id=unique_run_id,\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### `drop_experiment_from_logger()`\n",
    "Removes specific experiments from log files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where used:**\n",
    "- Not directly called in the main code, but available for use in scripts or notebooks to remove experiments from log files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**\n",
    "- `experiment_id` (str/int): ID of experiment to remove (`-1` for most recent)\n",
    "- `log_path` (str): Path to the log file\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from slim_gsgp.utils.logger import drop_experiment_from_logger\n",
    "drop_experiment_from_logger(-1, \"log/gp.csv\")\n",

    "## Usage in GP\n",
    "\n",
    "The logging system is automatically integrated into the `gp()` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Progress Logging:** Each generation's results are logged to `log_path` (default: `log/gp.csv`)\n",
    "- **Settings Logging:** Configuration parameters are saved to `{log_path}_settings.csv`\n",
    "- **Unique Run IDs:** Each experiment gets a UUID for identification\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Log File Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Main log file** contains per-generation data:\n",
    "  - Run information (algorithm, ID, dataset)\n",
    "  - Seed, generation number\n",
    "  - Elite fitness, timing, node count\n",
    "  - Optional test fitness and diversity metrics\n",
    "- **Settings log file** contains:\n",
    "  - Unique run ID\n",
    "  - Merged configuration dictionaries (see above)\n",
